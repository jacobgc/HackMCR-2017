# HackMCR-2017

## Overview
This site was made for a 2 day hackathon, Hack Manchester JNR 2017. We (@amiegreaves, @dean808) chose a challenge that asked us to create a site for the Co-op.

 ### Challenge brief
 "We want to find digital ways to help people who've lost someone they love. These recently bereaved people often feel lonely because their friends don't know what to say or how to behave around them."

 ## What we did
 We created a site with login/registration + a profile. We created a local events lookup that uses google maps to get your current location and find local events from meetup.com.

 We also used a forum to allow users to talk to each other about their feelings or just general chit chat.

 # We won :)
